# HANet

This system uses three different types of models. According to the notebook, linked below:

> HANet explores the potential of mix-and-matching various components from existing deep learning models. The approach includes a few general architectures (VAE, GAN, VAE-GAN), each consists of components (Q, G, D), and each component consists of layers (Conv2D, Dense, etc).
