# Chaining Models

The article [Active Divergence with Generative Deep Learning - A Survey and Taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05599) defines these methods in this way:

> The ensembles used will often utilise standard unconditional generative models, such as GANs, in combination with other conditional generative models (...)

The idea is to use various types of generation models, merge them and generate novelty-loaded artifacts.
