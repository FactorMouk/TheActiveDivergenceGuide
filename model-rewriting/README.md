# Model Rewriting

The article [Active Divergence with Generative Deep Learning - A Survey and Taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05599) defines these methods in this way:

> Model rewriting encompasses approaches where either the
weights or network topology are altered in a targeted way,
through manual intervention or by using some form of
heuristic based optimisation algorithm.
