# Targeted Rewriting

Here we have a GitHub and a colab which. According to the official page:

> We present the task of model rewriting, which aims to add, remove, and alter the semantic and physical rules of a pre-trained deep network. While modern image editing tools achieve a user-specified goal by manipulating individual input images, we enable a user to synthesize an unbounded number of new images by editing a generative model to carry out modified rules.
