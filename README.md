> A dossier of Active Divergence Methods for Computational Creativity

This documentation was created from research and cataloging of practical uses of Active Divergence algorithms, considering the creation of art artifacts through Deep Learning.

This guide was developed based on the article [Active Divergence with Generative Deep Learning - A Survey and Taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05599), by Terence Broad, Sebastian Berns, Simon Colton and Mick Grierso.

Before we understand the concept of Active Divergence, we need to unravel the concept of Divergence in creativity. Guilford defines that there are two paths in a creative process, both complementing each other: Divergence and Convergence. This first represents the conceptual distance from the base of ideas and initial information given a context of generating something new, with a view to creating new options that move away from this base without completely losing it, building something increasingly original.

It is possible to associate this concept with methods in Deep Learning algorithms for generating artifacts that seek not to replicate the training data set. This allows more and more novelty-laden artifacts to be generated, and for not only developers to use such tools, but also artists and enthusiasts in general.

We therefore have the concept of Active Divergence: methods of actively modifying the models or the process of a generation algorithm (such as GANs) with the aim of a more original generation of artifacts.

With that in mind, we have here in this documentation a dossier based on the article by Terence Broad, Sebastian Berns, Simon Colton and Mick Grierso mentioned above, with explanations about some methods already cataloged and links to Google Colabs and interesting repositories on GitHub, with the aim of to help research in this area that is so promising.
