# Network Bending

The article [Active Divergence with Generative Deep Learning - A Survey and Taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05599) defines these methods in this way:

> Network bending (...) allows for active divergence using individual pre-trained models without making any changes to the weights or topology of the model. Instead, additional layers that implement standard image filters are inserted into the computational graph of a model and applied during inference to the activation maps of the convolutional features.
