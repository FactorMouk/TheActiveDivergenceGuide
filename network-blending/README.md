# Network Blending

The article [Active Divergence with Generative Deep Learning - A Survey and Taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05599) defines these methods in this way:

> Blending multiple models trained on different dataset allows
for more control over the combination of learned features
from different domains. This can either be done by blending
the predictions of the models, or by blending the parameters
of the models themselves.
