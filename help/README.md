# How can I help?

This is an ever-expanding dossier. If you are interested in contributing corrections or new content, the process is very simple:

1. First, go to [documentation](https://github.com/FactorMouk/TheActiveDivergenceGuide) GitHub.
2. Fork the repository.
3. If you want to add information to an existing theme, look for the corresponding directory and make the changes in the README.md file.
> If you need tips for writing in markdown language, go to [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#overview).
4. If you want to add a new theme or sub-theme, create a directory with a README.md file for each theme, repeating the process for the sub-themes within the themes. Don't forget to update the `_sidebar.md` file.
5. Create a Pull Request from your modifications in your forked repository. For more information on how to do this, visit [this link](https://docs.github.com/pt/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).
