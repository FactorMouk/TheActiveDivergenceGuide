# Creative Adversarial Networks

This repository very figuratively demonstrates the use of a so-called Creative Adversarial Nertwork (CAN), using the wikiart dataset, which separates artworks into labels by style.

The repository is based on an [article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07068) by Ahmed Elgammal, Bingchen Liu, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Marian Mazzone, which describes the use of this method, and it can be accessed using the button below.
