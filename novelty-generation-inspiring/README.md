# Novelty generation from an inspiring set

The objective of these methods is to model the GANs using the training sets as inspiration sets, generating artifacts that were not modeled directly.

The article [Active Divergence with Generative Deep Learning - A Survey and Taxonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05599) defines these methods in this way:

> The methods in this section train a model from scratch using a training dataset, but do not attempt to model the data
directly, rather using it as reference material to draw inspiration from.
